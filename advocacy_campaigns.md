# Advocacy Campaign

This document defines the Advocacy Campaign resource. 

Advocacy campaigns represent an advocacy action directed at targets such as elected officials that a user may participate in by contacting those officials in some way, such as via email or phone. Advocacy campaigns have fields to describe them such as names, titles, summaries, descriptions, and targeting information, and when activists participate in an advocacy campaign, [Outreach](outreaches.html) resources are created representing the individual outreach an activist made to a target as part of that advocacy campaign.

### Scenario: Creating a new advocacy campaign (POST)

Posting to the advocacy campaign collection endpoint will allow you to create a new advocacy campaign. The response is the new advocacy campaign that was created. While each implementing system will require different fields, any optional fields not included in a post operation should not be set at all by the receiving system, or should be set to default values.

### Scenario: Modifying an advocacy campaign (PUT)

You can update an advocacy campaign by calling a PUT operation on that advocacy campaign's endpoint. Your PUT should contain fields that you want to update. Missing fields will be ignored by the receiving system. Systems may also ignore PUT values, depending on whether fields you are trying to modify are read-only or not. You may set an attribute to nil by including the attribute using `nil` for value.
