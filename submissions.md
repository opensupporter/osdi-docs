# Submission

This document defines the Submission resource. 

Submissions are a type of action that a user may take by completing a form. Submissions have fields to describe them such as when the submission was created and typically are linked to the person who made the submission as well as any information they submitted in the form of [Question](#) and [Question Answer](#) resources.

### Scenario: Creating a new submission (POST)

Posting to the submissions collection endpoint and including a link to an existing Person resource will allow you to create a new submission associated with that form and person. The response is the new submission that was created. While each implementing system will require different fields, any optional fields not included in a post operation should not be set at all by the receiving system, or should be set to default values.

For information on how to link a submission with a question answer, see the [Question Answers](#) documentation. For information on how to create a person along with a submission, see the [Record Submission Helper](record_submission.html) documentation.

### Scenario: Modifying a submission (PUT)

You can update a submission by calling a PUT operation on that submission's endpoint. Your PUT should contain fields that you want to update. Missing fields will be ignored by the receiving system. Systems may also ignore PUT values, depending on whether fields you are trying to modify are read-only or not. You may set an attribute to nil by including the attribute using `nil` for value.
