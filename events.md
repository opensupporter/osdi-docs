# Event

This document defines the Event resource.

Event resources represent an event that a user may attend by submitting their RSVP information. Events have fields to describe them such as names, titles, summaries, descriptions, dates, times, and locations, and when people RSVP to attend an event, [Attendance](attendances.html) resources are created representing the individual RSVP made by an activist made for that event. Events can be one of two types, ```open``` or ```ticketed```. Ticketed events typically charge money for tickets when a person RSVPs, while open events do not.

### Scenario: Creating a new event (POST)

Posting to the event collection endpoint will allow you to create a new event. Optionally adding links to a Person resource will set the organizer or creator. The response is the new event that was created. While each implementing system will require different fields, any optional fields not included in a post operation should not be set at all by the receiving system, or should be set to default values.

### Scenario: Modifying an event (PUT)

You can update an event by calling a PUT operation on that event's endpoint. Your PUT should contain fields that you want to update. Missing fields will be ignored by the receiving system. Systems may also ignore PUT values, depending on whether fields you are trying to modify are read-only or not. You may set an attribute to nil by including the attribute using `nil` for value.
