# Canvassing Effort

This page defines the Canvassing Effort resource.

Canvassing Efforts represent specific canvassing/phone banking events planned for a specific time period. The resource contains information about start and end time, people to be canvassed or called, and a [Script](scripts.html) that is used for the effort. As people are contacted, [Canvass](canvasses.html) resources are created representing the individual interaction between a canvasser and a person, as well as the data that resulted from that interaction.

### Scenario: Creating a new Canvassing Effort (POST)

Posting to the effort collection endpoint will allow you to create a new Canvassing Effort. The response is the new Canvassing Effort that was created. While each implementing system will require different fields, any optional fields not included in a post operation should not be set at all by the receiving system, or should be set to default values.

### Scenario: Modifying a Canvassing Effort (PUT)

You can update an effort by calling a PUT operation on that effort's endpoint. Your PUT should contain fields that you want to update. Missing fields will be ignored by the receiving system. Systems may also ignore PUT values, depending on whether fields you are trying to modify are read-only or not. You may set an attribute to nil by including the attribute using `nil` for value.
