# Queries
A query is a collection of resources that fit a set of criteria

* Queries are nonarbitrary: a resource's inclusion in the collection is based on attributes intrinsic to that resource
* Queries may be static or dynamic: A dynamic query will return the resources which match its criteria at the moment the query is retrieved. A static query will contain the resources which matched its criteria at the time the query was created
* Queries may only be created, deleted and edited on the content provider's native system; OSDI does not support 
* Query metadata may be updated via the API, but query criteria may only be modified and queries may only be created or deleted via the content provider's system
* Queries are unique collections of resources: a resource may match a query only once

| name 	| type	| description	|
|-------|-------|---------------|
| identifiers | Identifier[] | An array of identifiers
| description	| string	| description of the query's function; if possible, enough data to recreate query on the host system	|
| dynamic		| boolean	| denotes whether the query is dynamic or static	|
| created_date	| timestamp	| time the query was created	|
| origin_system | string    | Human readable identifier of the system where this query was created
| name		| string	| name of the query	|
| total_items	| integer	| number of items in the query	|
| osdi_items | []*	 | the collection of resources which match the query's criteria at the time of the query's creation in static queries or at the time of retrieval in dynamic queries	|


# Items
An item is an individual member of a query, linked to a resource type such as a person. An item can be of any resource type. Items are unique within their query.

| name 	| type	| description	|
|-------|-------|---------------|
| identifiers | Identifier[] | An array of identifiers
| created_date	| timestamp	| time the item was created	|
| origin_system | string    | Human readable identifier of the system where this item was created
| item_type     | string      | the type of item, eg "osdi:person"
