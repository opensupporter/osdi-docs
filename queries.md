#Queries
A query is a collection of resources that fit a set of criteria
* Queries are nonarbitrary: a resource's inclusion in the collection is based on attributes intrinsic to that resource
* Queries may be static or dynamic: A dynamic query will return the resources which match its criteria at the moment the query is retrieved. A static query will contain the resources which matched its criteria at the time the query was created
* Queries may only be created, deleted and edited on the content provider's native system; OSDI does not support 
* Query metadata may be updated via the API, but query criteria may only be modified and queries may only be created or deleted via the content provider's system
* Queries are unique collections of resources: a resource may match a query only once
